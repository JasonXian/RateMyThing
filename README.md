# RateMyThing
Website for users to sign up and showcase various things they own and get ratings from other users.
This website might be helpful if you have lots of junk in your house that you might be on the fence about getting rid of or if you just want some cool discussion about weird things you own!

This website is my first attempt at learning how to do back-end for a website, it utilizes HTML/CSS/Bootstrap for front-end, MongoDB, Express.js and Node.js for back-end.

Users are able to register for an account using their email, with user authentication through passport.js and have a unique personal page on the site showcasing their things.

When creating new things, users are also given the option upload a photo and input a location of the thing, which uses google maps api to display a map of the location.
